    basically does is creates basically a blank object that has nothing in it. And then runs the code inside a function
    PartyAnimal to give some form to that object, right? And so this right here is the constructor, right? And so I just
    put a console.log so you can kind of see where that happens. It says, I'm in the constructor. And then this thing
    works the exact same way. It's just a kind of instrumented the moment that we're in the constructor, okay? And the
    purpose of the constructor in object orientation is to set the initial conditions of the object so that the object
    is ready to be used. And like setting x to 0, setting x to 0, is apparently for this object, a necessary condition.
